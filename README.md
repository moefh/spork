## Name

Why "spork"?

A sporks are in the awkward middle-ground between a fork and a spoon:
its prongs are not sharp enough to stab, and it doesn't hold soup as
well as a spoon.

Likewise, this project is in the awkward middle-ground of low-level
and high-level. It doesn't offer the speed and control of native
compilation, nor does it offer the convenience of high level
languages, like automatic memory management.
